			<h2>Latest TTC News</h2>

			<h5>Updated as Required</h5>
			<p>the TTC was the victim of a cybersecurity incident that impacted a number of its customer and internal services. This incident did not cause significant service disruption. However, the TTC did lose some of our operator and customer-facing features that are now back online and working normally. The TTC has been working closely with leading cybersecurity experts to investigate and restore its systems. Thid was a sophisticated incident, similar to hundreds reported in Canada last year.</p>
			<p>Upon learning about this incident, the TTC promptly began an investigation. Based on the investigation so far, it now appears that personal information of some TTC employees, former employees and pensioners may have been stolen.</p>
			<p>This information may include names, addresses and Social Insurance Numbers of up to 25,000 TTC employees, past and present. The TTC continues to investigate whether a small number of customers and vendors may also have been affected and will notify when there is further information as appropriate.</p>
			<p>Impacted employees will be notified directly by letter. As the investigation continues, we will reach out to additional individuals who may be affected to offer assistance as appropriate.</p>
			<p>This matter is of the utmost importance to the TTC and is being treated as a top priority. The TTC apologizes for the inconvenience this is causing affected individuals.</p>
